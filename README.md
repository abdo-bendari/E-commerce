# About 

This eCommerce application is meticulously crafted to deliver an unparalleled online shopping experience for users seeking to purchase products effortlessly. It accommodates two primary user types: regular customers and administrators. Regular customers enjoy the convenience of exploring a diverse array of products, adding items to their shopping carts, and completing transactions securely through two flexible payment options: cash on delivery and credit card payments via Stripe. Administrators, on the other hand, possess the tools to manage product inventories, address customer inquiries, and streamline order processing, ensuring optimal operational efficiency.
The project's objective is to simplify the online shopping journey while providing robust features that enhance user satisfaction. With an intuitive interface, advanced product filtering capabilities, and secure payment processing, this application not only saves valuable time for customers but also empowers businesses to effectively manage their online sales and enhance their market presence.
